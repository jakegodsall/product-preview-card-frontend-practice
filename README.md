# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

The desktop version of the product preview card:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="complete-desktop.png" alt="desktop-image" width="60%">
</div>

and the mobile version of the card:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="complete-mobile.png" alt="desktop-image" width="25%">
</div>


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media queries

### What I learned

With this project I learned to add an image by creating a `div` and setting its `background-image` property rather than the standard `img` HTML element. 
This allowed me to more easily use flexbox for the layout of the component.

Also, this is my first time using media queries for responsiveness of the layout. 

### Continued development

Although I have managed to get the desired layout for the component at the specified desktop and mobile viewports, the component does not look great at intermediate sizes. I plan to continue learning responsive web design and how to allow for smoother transitions.
